## Introduction

**Presence** is an AI-native attendance management system built for modern teams. It combines real-time tracking, global compliance, and effortless management into a single, powerful platform.

### What is Presence?

Presence is a comprehensive attendance tracking solution that helps organizations:

- Track employee attendance in real-time
- Ensure compliance with labor laws
- Generate detailed analytics and reports
- Manage teams across multiple locations
- Automate scheduling and shift management

### Problems Presence Solves

#### 1. **Attendance Fraud Prevention**
Traditional attendance systems are vulnerable to buddy punching and time theft. Presence uses AI-powered facial recognition to verify that the right person is checking in at the right time.

#### 2. **Complex Compliance Management**
Different regions have different labor laws, break requirements, and overtime policies. Presence automatically handles these complexities, reducing legal risks and administrative burden.

#### 3. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**
Many systems provide data with significant delays. Presence offers real-time dashboards that give you immediate insight into workforce capacity and attendance patterns.

#### 4. **Manual Scheduling Errors**
Creating schedules manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Presence's smart scheduling detects conflicts automatically and suggests optimal coverage.

#### 5. **Distributed Team Challenges**
Managing attendance across multiple locations, time zones, and work arrangements is complex. Presence handles global teams with ease, supporting remote, hybrid, and on-site workers.

#### 6. **Poor Employee Experience**
Many attendance systems are clunky and frustrating. Presence offers mobile-first apps that employees actually enjoy using, increasing adoption and reducing support costs.
