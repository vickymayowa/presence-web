# Notifications

## Overview

Staying informed is critical for timely attendance management. Presence provides a notification system that alerts relevant users about important events, such as leave requests, approvals, and missed check-ins.

## Notification Types

- **Leave Requests**: Managers are notified when an employee submits a request.
- **Approvals/Rejections**: Employees are notified when their request is processed.
- **Missed Check-In Alert**: (Optional) Admin alert if specific employees haven't checked in by a deadline.
- **Schedule Changes**: Alerts when shifts are assigned or modified.

## Viewing Notifications

1. Look for the **Bell Icon** in the top navigation bar of the dashboard.
2. A red dot indicates unread notifications.
3. Click the icon to view the list of recent alerts.
4. Click on a notification to navigate to the relevant page (e.g., the specific leave request).

## Marking as Read

- Click **Mark all as read** to clear the unread status of all notifications.
- Individual notifications are marked as read when you click on them.
